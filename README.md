# StarCCM_Presentation
This macro was designed to hep automate your STAR-CCM post-processes. This repo contains a macro which exports all scenes and plots to a separate folder. Once completed, run the supplied python file to complete post processing by generating a presentation with all scenes and plots labelled. deeply useful for FSAE, Formula Student and other projects which require documentation of multiple simulations.
