# StarCCM_Presentation
This macro was designed to hep automate your STAR-CCM post-processes. This repo contains a macro which exports all scenes and plots to a separate folder. Once completed, run the supplied python file to complete post processing by generating a presentation with all scenes and plots labelled. deeply useful for FSAE, Formula Student and other projects which require documentation of multiple simulations.

Files included:
1. ExportScenesAndPlots.java: This is the inital macro to be used in STAR-CCM. This downloads the scenes and plots to an external folder.
2. NitroMacro.py: This is to be ran after the scenes and plots are exported. This generates the presentation
3. Demo_Presentation.pptx: A demo presentation, shows what the current presentation generated should look like.
